Hi there! I'm Helder S. Viana and I work as developer and DBA for the last years.
Right now my main tecnhical skills are development in .net (C# and VB.net), T-SQL, C/AL (Dynamics NAV), PHP and some other stuff. 


### Experience

Since 2008 I work in the area of ​​IT, started as a PHP developer, then I worked on some website projects and CMS's, moustly as a freelancer.
In 2009 I started working in a new project a WMS that we used to use internally in the company where I currently work.
However, I got involved into ERP development, namely in Visual FoxPro (yes I know, that language is dead, by the way when I started working on Visual FoxPro it was already dead and discontinued by Microsoft). At the same time I was developing in .Net (I confess, at first I started with VB.Net, yes "it seemed to me" simpler and more intuitive). In Concurrent I always kept the work with T-SQL, basically it is our Single source of truth, so I used to be one of the guys who build some fancy t-sql reports.
After this adventure in FoxPro, the company where I worked changed ERP, we started using Dynamics NAV, I had to adapt to C/AL, the NAV native language. 
Currently I'm more dedicated to the development of application interfaces, for this I use .Net, but this time, I stay for C#, it is fast, efficient and gives the job done. Now a days I work with SOAP services, REST services, MVC web app's, IIS, NAV and a bunch of other stuff.
At this point I am trying to terminate MCSA in SQL Server and I am delving more and more C#, to be my main reference. So suddenly, I think I'll give Python an opportunity in the near future, it seems to be more intuitive than C# and in a line of code I do the same thing as 10 lines in C#.
