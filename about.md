Hi there! I'm Helder Viana and I'm a typeof(developer). I have worked as a developer and a DBA for the last years, mostly focused on .net development (C# and vb.net [yes, I'm Ok working with vb.net]) and T-SQL.
Right now my main tecnhical skills are related to Microsoft ecosystem and the development in .net and T-SQL.

### Early days

It all started during my childhood in the afternoons spent playing Pac-Man in my father's work. This was my first contact with computers. The game was very lively and fast, I remember myself, and the OS I'm sure it was DOS... years later here I am on the other side of the barricade developing software as if there was no tomorrow.

### Experience

Since 2008 I work in the area of ​​IT, started as a PHP developer, then I worked on some website projects and CMS's, moustly as a freelancer.
In 2009 I started working in a new project a WMS that we used to use internally in the company where I currently work.
However, I got involved into ERP development (PHC), namely in Visual FoxPro (yes I know, that language is dead, by the way when I started working on Visual FoxPro it was already dead and discontinued by Microsoft). At the same time I was developing in .Net (I confess, at first I started with VB.Net, yes "it seemed to me" simpler and more intuitive). In Concurrent I always kept the work with T-SQL, basically it is our Single source of truth, so I used to be one of the guys who build some fancy t-sql reports.
After this adventure in FoxPro, the company where I worked changed ERP, we started using Dynamics NAV, I had to adapt to C/AL, the NAV native language and I started to learn who to develop in C/AL.
Currently I'm more dedicated to the development of application interfaces, for this I use .Net, but this time, I stay for C#, it is fast, efficient and gives the job done. Now a days I work with SOAP services, REST services, MVC web app's, IIS, NAV and a bunch of other stuff, soon I hope to star using REDIS and containers technologies, to start designing webservices in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) style.
At this point I am trying to finish MCSA in SQL Server and I am delving more and more C#, to be my main reference. So suddenly, I think I'll give Python an opportunity in the near future, it seems to be more intuitive than C# and in a line of code I do the same thing as 10 lines in C#.

### Goals
I learned to recognize that my main purpose in my profession is not just to write code (and I love it), I love a good challenge and what I like most about this profession is to be surprised with problems and to be able to solve them. Problem solving is my ultimate goal, for that I can write code, design software, design procedures, design strategies, but the main purpose is to solve problems. I'm a problem solver.

### MVA Certification
Here you can find some [courses](https://meocloud.pt/link/e5287e4b-0fe9-45f8-879a-0fa504239752/Transcript.pdf/) that I completed in [Microsoft Virtual Academy](https://mva.microsoft.com/) (MVA) in the last years. My learning plan has a lot more, but it  has been complicated to finish them.
