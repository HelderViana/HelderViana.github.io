# Python: The Documentary | An origin story
## Python, the programming language.
As someone fascinated by the history of computing, yesterday I stumbled upon the release of the documentary [Python: The Documentary | An origin story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfH4QL4VqJ0). I really enjoyed watching it — not only because it runs parallel to my own career as a programmer, but also because I could clearly remember some of the moments in time it revisits.

It gave me a fresh and deeper perspective on Python itself. And that felt especially relevant right now, since I’ve been working a lot more with this technology lately — both in professional projects and in personal experiments.

Thought it was worth sharing here, along with the links.
