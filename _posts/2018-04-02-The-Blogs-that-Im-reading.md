# Reading Blogs
This and last week I was reading some technical blogs, some of them are related to work that I'm doing, some of them are sugestions that apeard on my [twitter account](https://twitter.com/hdsviana) and some of them are the result on the search of some technical subjects that I'm interested on.

As a part of my sharing spirit I share in this blog post to you some of the blogs that I found in the last week.
The majour of the articles are related to .net development and T-SQL (ok, when I say T-SQL most of the time is related to SQL Server, it is my favourite database engine and I worked with SQL Server on a daily base in the last 8 years).


## Free Certificates on IIS with Lets Encrypt
In this [article at mikesdotnetting](https://www.mikesdotnetting.com/article/305/free-ssl-certificates-on-iis-with-letsencrypt) is all about the Lets Encrypt Free Certificates and how to deploy them to IIS. [Lets Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority that allows the creation of free ("free as in beer") certificates. This article is very usefull to manage and deploy a Lets Encrypt Cert on a IIS server, you can easily use this article to handle the deploy in multiple servers.


## DBA from Scratch
This article is all about the [path to became a Data Platform MVP](https://dbafromthecold.com/2018/03/14/how-i-became-a-dataplatform-mvp/) by Andrew Pruski, a must read if you want to know how to follow the path to MVP.


## GitHub Extension for Visual Studio
As Visual Studio is one of the best IDE in the world, I start looking arround for a better integretion with GitHub, that's why [I found this article](https://haacked.com/archive/2018/03/15/github-vs-pr-features/) by Phil Haack, and then I also found this [awsome VS extension](https://visualstudio.github.com/) (yes I know, I found it too late) but it is a must have in case you use GitHub and Visual Studio.


## Getting Started with Azure Translator API
I'm very interested in this subject and I found this [article from the MVP Iris Classon](http://irisclasson.com/2018/03/29/getting-started-with-azure-translator-api/) on her blog showing how to use the Azure Translator API, and with a C# example on that. I would like to try it in one chat bot, I think it will be awsome!


## LOADING AN OBJECT FROM SQL SERVER USING DAPPER
Finnaly I started to read the first of three article on [how to use Dapper with SQL Server](https://aspnetmonsters.com/2018/01/2018-01-22-loading-an-object-graph-with-dapper/) on ASP.Net Monsters website. I recentlly start using Dapper on a Proof of Concept project and I realyse that Dapper is a must have middleware to handle the SQL querys and the C# Business Class that it represents on the app side! It works across all .NET ADO providers including SQLite, SQL CE, Firebird, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQL Server, as it is explained on [dapper github page](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper). At this moment I only tested it on SQL Server 2017 and I'm pleased!


## Being a senior software developer
One of this days I found this article on [Being a senior software developer](https://medium.com/@lsoares/being-a-senior-developer-380349b1c1dd) by Lu√≠s Soares one Portuguese (like me) full-stack web developer. I don't know how I found it, maybe on twitter, maybe not, but I still have one open tab on my Chrome browser on his page. It is a very interesting reading, in my case because I'm also on the "senior dev" side.


For now this is all. I'll try to share with you more articles that I'm on the mood to read, in the near future.
