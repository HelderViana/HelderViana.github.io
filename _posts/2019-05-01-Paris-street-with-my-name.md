# Rue du Helder in Paris

I usually travel a lot to Paris for work (the HQ of the company I work for is in Paris) and last April I went as usual to Paris and by chance I found one street with my name in Paris! It was very funny to find out a place with my name in there.

It seems that the origins of this street is not related to the Portuguese name Helder, like mine, it is related to a port in Netherlands, located in North Holland opposite the island of Texel, the port is called Helder. I found one reference in [French wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rue_du_Helder) with this information.

It is a fun fact!
