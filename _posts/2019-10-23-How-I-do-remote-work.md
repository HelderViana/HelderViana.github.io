# How I do Remote Work

The compay I work for  has a brand new IT Office in Porto (Portugal), since 2017. I joined the company late 2017 and it is my first experience in a Nearshore model. Since 2018 all the teams can work remotely for several days in one month. We are not a remote first company, but this company has one allow remote work policy for all of it's workers.

I started working remotely a few days a month now, I try at least one day a week and now have setup my home work palce, the goal is to use the work palce as my home work, connecting my company's laptop and my own laptop.

## Equipment
My option about the equipment was mostly focus on one monitor with USB Type C, to connect to my work laptop. I choose the Monitor Lenovo ThinkVision P27h-10 IPS 27" QHD, mostly because of the low price (available for my budget) and it has USB-C. Some of the specs are the follwoing:
+ Screen size  27";
+ Aspect Ratio 16:9;
+ Resolution 2560 x 1440 @ 60Hz;
+ IPS;
+ 1 x HDMI;
+ 1 x DisplayPort;
+ 1 x Out DisplayPort;
+ 4 x USB 3.0 Type-A;
+ 1 x USB 3.1 Type-C;

Besides the monitor, I got one Trust gamming mouse and one PT-PT logitech keyboard.


## Work Place
About my chair and desk, well, I already have them, I have one desk and one chair from IKEA, some old models, that didn't show up in IKEA's web site. My goal is to replace them, mostly the chair, because the my back.
