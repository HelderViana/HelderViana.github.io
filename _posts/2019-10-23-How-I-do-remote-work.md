#How I do Remote Work

The compay I work for is [Natixis](https://www.natixis.com/), one French investment back, with a brand new IT Office in Porto (Portugal), since 2017. I joined the company late 2017 and it is my first experience in a Nearshore model. Since 2018 all the teams can work remotely for several days in one month. We are not a remote first company, but Natixis has one allow remote work policy for all of it's workers.

I started working remotely a few days a month now, I try at least one day a week and
I usually travel a lot to Paris for work (the HQ of the company I work for is in Paris) and last April I went as usual to Paris and by chance I found one street with my name in Paris! It was very funny to find out a place with my name in there.

It seems that the origins of this street is not related to the Portuguese name Helder, like mine, it is related to the battle of Fort Helder, which the English army had tried to remove from the French in 1799. Helder is a port in Netherlands, located in North Holland opposite the island of Texel. I found one reference in [French wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rue_du_Helder) with this information.

It is a fun fact!
