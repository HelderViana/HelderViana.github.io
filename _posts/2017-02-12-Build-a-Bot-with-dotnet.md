This is my first experience building a bot and it happened by chance and as proof of concept for future applications.
At this moment my language of choice is <b>C#</b> and as such I went looking for some framework that I could use in .Net I ended up by comparing the Microsoft Bot Famework, still in preview, but I decided to try and download the template for visualstudio.
After installing the template I created a new project and then I downloaded the Emulator to be able to test it. At this point the Bot was just a web project running in visualstudio with an REST api with one or two methods available for use by the emulator.
