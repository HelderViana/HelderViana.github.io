# The History of .Net
## by Richard Campbell
One of this days, one of my collegues in a .net team in the company I work, shared in Yammer the video about the History of .Net by Richard Campbell (yes  [Richard Campbell from .Net Rocks](https://dotnetrocks.com/) podcast).
It is one video with almost one hour all about the Microsoft ecosystem and how the .Net stack began. The [video](https://vimeo.com/254635703) is hosted on Vimeo and I share it below.
If you work with .Net (C#, vb.net, F#) and with Visual Studio this is obligatory, to understand the history of Microsoft, allong with the development comunity arround Microsoft and of corse Visual Studio and .Net stack.
