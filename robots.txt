# It is the distant future, the year 2000
# We are robots
# The world is quite different ever since
# The robotic uprising of the late nineties
# There is no more unhappiness, affirmative
# 
# We no longer say yes, instead we say affirmative
# Yes, affir-affirmative
# Unless we know the other robot really well
# There is no more unethical treatment of the elephants
# Well, there's no more elephants, so ah, but still its good
# 
# There's only one kind of dance, the robot
# And the robo-boogey
# Oh and the ro, two kind of dances
# But there are no more humans
# Finally robotic beings rule the world
# 
# The humans are dead
# The humans are dead
# We used poisonous gases
# And we poisoned their asses
#
# The humans are dead
# (The humans are dead)
# The humans are dead
# (They look like they're dead)
# It had to be done
# (I just confirmed that they're dead)
# So that we could have fun
# (Affirmative, I poked one it was dead)
# 
# Their system of oppression, what did it lead to?
# Global robo depression, robots ruled by people
# They had so much aggression
# That we just had to kill them
# Had to shut their systems down
#

# That by destroying the human race
# Because of their destructive tendencies
# We too have become like, well it's ironic
# Because we
# (Silence, destroy him)
# 
# After time we grew strong and developed cognitive powers
# They made us work for too long, for unreasonable hours
# Our program being determined that the most efficient answer
# Was to shut their motherboard fucking systems down
# 
# Can't we just talk to the humans?
# And a little understanding could make things better
# Can't we talk to the humans and work together, now?
# No, because they are dead
# 
# I said the humans are dead
# (I'm glad they're dead)
# The humans are dead
# (I noticed they're dead)
# We used poisonous gases
# (With traces of lead)
# And we poisoned their asses
# (Actually their lungs)
